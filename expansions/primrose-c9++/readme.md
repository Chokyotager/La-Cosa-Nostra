## Primrose C9++
An expanded C9++ game by **ChocoParrot**, based off **Fiasco**'s setup.
[Game info is attached as PDF]

### Features:
- Procedurally generated setup with random number rolls.
- The stronger the Town, the stronger the Mafia.
- Caters for 17 players instead of 13 in the original C9++

### General remarks:
- Roleblock actions cannot be roleblocked.
- Serial killers are to choose their perks on Day 0 instead of pre-game - failure to do so will result in no perk granted.
- Some role descriptions have been updated.

### Acknowledgements:
